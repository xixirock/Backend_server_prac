// Phase II: For this second phase, aim to complete the following:

//     Backend Team:

//     Create a basic Express server.

// Your server at this point should do the BARE MINIMUM.(Effectively, it should just say: “Listening at PORT 3000” when the command node server.js is run.)

// =====================================================================================

// Phase III: For this third phase, aim to complete the following:

//Backend Team:

//Create a set of variables(hint: arrays of objects) for holding the reservation and waitlist data

// Create a set of routes that then display this data as JSONs.Users should be given these JSONs
// if they visit the appropriate page(i.e.if a user visits localhost: 3000 / api / tables they should see a JSON of table data). (RECOMMENDED TO USE POSTMAN FOR TESTING/DEBUGGING)

// =====================================================================================

// Phase IV: For this fourth phase, aim to complete the following:

//     Backend Team:

//     Create the logic that handles reservation requests.Your code should work such that POST requests take in JSON objects, checks
// if there is any space left, then adds the JSON object to either the reservation array or the waitlist array.Your POST route should also respond to requests with a confirmation(true or false) of whether or not the requestor has a reservation(or is on the waiting list).

// You should be using Postman to do all your testing at this point.

// =====================================================================================

// Phase V: For the fifth and final phase, aim to complete the following:

//     All:

//     Complete any remaining functionality from the previous phase
// if you need more time.

// Then, thoroughly test your application
// for bugs.Check
// if there are any obvious ways to crash the application.

// Then,
// if you have more time--begin to tackle any bonus of your choice.
